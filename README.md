<h1>Spotfy (Remake)</h1>
<b></b>Introduction</b>
Welcome to "Spotfy," my recreation of the Spotify interface with my unique twist. This project focuses on the visual design of Spotify and includes dark and light mode functionality, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Spotify-Inspired Interface: Mimics the look and feel of the original Spotify.
Dark and Light Modes: Toggle between themes for visual comfort.
Here are some pictures of how it looks like:
